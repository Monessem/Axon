   Version 0.5
        - Titles from Wikipedia like EBay, IPhone, etc. are now lowercased
          like the tag {{Lowercase title}} does on Wikipedia.
        - Fixed a bug where Wikipedia extracts with a lot of HTML tags would
          be shortened to about one sentence because the tags themselves
          were also counted as characters.
